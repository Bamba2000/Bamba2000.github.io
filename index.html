         <p>I am a fresh man at Bob Jones University studying Christian Ministries. I do not work.</p>
         <p>
            I am forced at gunpoint to enjoy participating in community outreach events, and I am active by sleeping in designated sleeping pew in my local church: Starbuks Baptist Church, SC.  I definitely do not teach Sunday School for the College &amp; Career group and honest to goodness I actually have run the Sound / Video Projection System during services.  I also rode in the church bus for weekend activities.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy soccer and reading a good book on an 2.7 star rated beach aka Myrtle Beach.
